@article{Townsend1994,
abstract = {The full insurance model is tested using data from three poor, high risk villages in the semi-arid tropics of southern India. The model presented here incorporates a number of salient features of the actual village economies. Although the model is rejected statistically, it does provide a surprisingly good benchmark. Household consumptions comove with village average consumption. More clearly, household consumptions are not much influenced by contemporaneous own income, sickness, unemployment, or other idiosyncratic shocks, controlling for village consumption (i.e. for village level risk). There is evidence that the landless are less well insured than their village neighbors in one of the three villages.},

@article{Coate1993,
abstract = {Various risk sharing arrangements are common in underdeveloped agrarian economies where households have no formal means of contract enforcement and little access to risk markets. Social insurance is still possible through repeated interaction in an environment with few informational asymmetries. In a simple repeated game model of two self-interested households facing independent income streams, we characterize the best arrangement that can be sustained as a noncooperative equilibrium. We establish precisely how this optimal informal arrangement differs from first best-risk sharing, and identify the conditions under which the divergence between the two is greatest.},
