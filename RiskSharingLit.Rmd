## Literature of Risk Sharing

In this document I introduce studies related to risk-sharing.
Here, by risk-sharing, I consider studies trying to understand the relationships between consumption and income and mechanisms to reduce the correlation through sharing income risks with others.
The seminal paper in this literature is @Townsend1994, and I introduce studies before and after this paper and try to relate each other.

### @Townsend1994 paper as a canonical full risk-sharing model

### Full risk-sharing model as in @Townsend1994

@Cochrane1991:

@Altonji1992: 

#### Risk-sharing under heterogeneity
